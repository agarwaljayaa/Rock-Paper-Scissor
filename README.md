# Rock-Paper-Scissor

This project is a simple implementation of the popular game "Stone Paper Scissors" using C language. The game allows a player to compete against the computer by making their choice of either stone, paper, or scissors. The computer then randomly selects one of these options, and the winner is determined based on the rules of the game.
